{"summary":"Today's research papers are about various advancements in machine learning, AI, and data processing across numerous domains. The first paper discusses the \"Data Addition Dilemma\" in healthcare machine learning, highlighting how adding more training data from dissimilar sources can negatively impact model accuracy and fairness, while suggesting strategies to navigate this issue. The second paper introduces a novel agentic workflow for AI city navigation that enables self-position establishment and planning by leveraging a memory mechanism. The third paper proposes \"Listwise Reward Estimation\" for offline preference-based reinforcement learning, improving how reward models are learned from human feedback. The fourth introduces \"STMGNN-ZINB,\" a framework for crime prediction that effectively handles sparse data through a specialized graph neural network. A fifth study analyzes effective pairwise judgment formulation for training a Semantic Embedding Model in web search, revealing insights into optimal training strategies. The sixth paper presents \"MMRole,\" a framework for developing multimodal role-playing agents, while the seventh discusses a chatbot designed for intrusion detection in edge networks with an emphasis on ethical user consent. The eighth paper proposes a framework to handle noisy clients in federated learning, enhancing model performance despite label noise. Further research analyzes the interaction with digital agents in education through activity theory, while another focuses on a knowledge-driven approach to zero-shot coordination in reinforcement learning. The next paper addresses optimal qubit permutations for CNOT circuit synthesis, and another introduces an innovative approach to time series anomaly prediction integrating delays and horizons. Moreover, a paper on Graph Analytics aims to improve legal judgment similarities, while another discusses non-maximizing policies in reinforcement learning scenarios. Further, a multimodal forecasting method is introduced that incorporates images into event prediction, followed by a discussion on out-of-distribution generalization in graph machine learning. The study on probabilistic energy forecasting emphasizes uncertainty quantification for energy demand, and another establishes \"FedAD-Bench,\" a benchmark for federated unsupervised anomaly detection. Finally, a paper explores automated reasoning in study regulations using Answer Set Programming, while another discusses a Synchronous Multimodal Semantic Communication System to enhance data transmission across channels."}
