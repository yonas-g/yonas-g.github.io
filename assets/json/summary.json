  "summary": "Today's research papers are about various innovative approaches to tackling specific challenges across different fields. The first paper presents TwIPS, an AI-powered texting app designed to assist autistic users in effectively interpreting and expressing emotional tones in communication. The second introduces the Babel framework for multi-modal sensing, which enhances the analysis of data with partial modality pairings for human activity recognition. The HC-GST framework addresses distribution shifts in graph self-training for heterophilic graphs, while AgentScope improves multi-agent simulations' scalability and flexibility. EEG-SSM introduces a state-space model for detecting dementia through EEG data by effectively integrating temporal and spectral features. The NC-NCD framework proposes a self-training strategy for novel class discovery in node classification. A dynamic Markov Decision Process is discussed to enhance fairness in ride-hailing platforms. The capabilities of the GPT-4o foundation model are explored in various atmospheric science tasks. An iterative approach to topic modeling aims to improve the quality of generated topics. Causal deepsets are proposed for off-policy evaluation, addressing assumptions limiting existing methods. Security vulnerabilities in LLMs' function calling are spotlighted, revealing attack pathways and defenses. ANNs are compared for Bitcoin price forecasting, showing that sequence length affects prediction accuracy. Generalization properties of LLMs in arithmetic reasoning are analyzed, offering insights for more effective model training. Peak-Controlled Logits Poisoning attack is introduced for Federated Distillation, emphasizing its disruptive potential. Lastly, a joint graph learning method leverages pre-trained transformers for inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA-seq data, outperforming existing techniques."
