I am a masters student in Egnineering Artificial Intelligence at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://cmu.edu). I am interested in the applications of machine learning and deep learning for speech processing. I am currently working on leveraging deep learning based models for automatic speech recognition, especially focusing on African languages in a low resource multilingual setup. I am also interested in the application of machine learning to the field of earth observation, currently working on flood extent prediction using opensource satellite imagery data. 

Prior to joining CMU, I was a software engineer at [Paga](https://mypaga.com) where I worked on building and scaling the backend infrastructure for the Paga mobile money platform focusing on the Paga agent network system. I have a Bachelors degree in Software Engineering from the [Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, Ethiopia](http://aastu.edu.et).



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
