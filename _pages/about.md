I am a Master's student in Engineering Artificial Intelligence at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://cmu.edu). My research interests lie in the applications of machine learning and deep learning for speech processing. Currently, I am focusing on utilizing deep learning-based models for automatic speech recognition, particularly in the context of African languages within a low-resource multilingual setup. Additionally, I am exploring the application of machine learning in the field of earth observation. Specifically, I am involved in a project that predicts flood extent using open-source satellite imagery data.

Before joining CMU, I worked as a software engineer at [Paga](https://mypaga.com), where I contributed to the development and scalability of the backend infrastructure for the Paga mobile money platform. My primary focus was on enhancing the Paga agent network system. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, Ethiopia](http://aastu.edu.et).
