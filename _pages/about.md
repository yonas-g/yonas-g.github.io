I am a Senior Deep Learning Engineer at __Pindo__, where I specialize in developing speech and language technologies. 
I hold a master's degree in __Engineering Artificial Intelligence__ from __Carnegie Mellon University__, where I focused on developing automatic speech recognition systems. 
My research interests include deep learning, and speech and natural language processing. I am passionate about using AI to solve real world problems, particularly in the context of efficient and scalable solutions for domains, including lowresource languages.

Before my current role, I served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Carnegie Mellon University, where I contributed to courses [Introduction Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu) and Machine Learning for Earth Observation. My background includes software engineering experience at Paga, where I worked on scalable backend infrastructure for mobile money platforms. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering (Very Great Distinction) from Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, Ethiopia.
